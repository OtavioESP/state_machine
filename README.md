Hello, my name is Otavio, this project its to show and explain my understanding of this software method.

The explanation will be in `EXPLANATION.md` file.

The application and the further interface, will be implemented in every folder inside the project.

The dependencies will be in the requirements.txt

To run it, you need python at least 3.7.x and package manager PIP

in the root folder, run:
# $ pip install -r requirements.txt

It will install the dependencys, and then to run it ( before interface implementation ):
# $ python main.py


Hope it helps you to improve your knowledge, even if it be just a little.

Im always open to critics, so feel free to say it.

Have fun!
